        <div class="subheading mb-5">Creative WritingðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Arlene Batres, and I am an undergraduate who is currently majoring in Creative Writing at the University of California Riverside and I am currently focused on Screenwriting and in writing fiction stories. I have attended multiple creative writing courses for example: Intro to Creative Writing, Creative Writing: Survey in Contemporary Creative Nonfiction and I am also involved in the creative writing program at UCR and have also worked with the theater program in Riverside as well. I am involved in multiple experiences in writing festivals and contests for both highschool, and college. I may have not won many contests but have ran in multiple events and continue to participate in these events till this day. I also have experience in acting classes, and playwriting and embodying characters in plays at UCR and highschool, and also playing characters in dramas for churches as well. I have even been exposed to many film clubs and courses available throughout highschool and college and I have learned the history of film from taking the class Cinema26-Survey American Cinema from Chaffey college and it has guided me to understand how a film is created from the writing portion, to the camera work and production and all the way to its releasing.
<br><br>

        I also have had leadership experience from ASB (Associated Student Body) and had a leadership position within CSI (Community Student Involvement) which allowed me to connect with multiple members of the community from ages 13 to 40 and up, and I was able to understand the mindset of each different age groups and understand what it is that these ages desire to see on the big screen and how distinct their personalities are from one another. This leadership experience gave me the skills to plan various events that would help me change the lives of many homeless people, and people in need of blood, and hundreds of kids whose parents might not have the finances to support them with toys, food, and activities. These skills guide me to understand how much necessity there is within these communities and how much making books, stories, and movies truly impact not only children but even the lives of adults.<br><br>

        I also have over 70 hours of community service. I volunteered with park clean ups, social events for the community, as well as helping teachers in schools with grading tests, papers, notes, and more. I was a part of the AVID program and Key Club which allowed me multiple access to events for the community as well as for highschools around the city. I was able to develop skills regarding communication and public speaking, as well as being exposed to different cities and the writing programs that reside in places such as San Francisco, Santa Barbra, Irvine, Santa Cruz, Northridge, Los Angeles, and more. I have also written multiple screenplays for events hosted in the city of Fontana and highschools inside the Fontana district. I have written dramas or plays for churches that have stories from the Bible and plays that have some sort of life lesson towards the end. Furthermore, I  truly enjoy making a difference in the lives of many people through film and writing.
